== Run

You need to have Java 10 or newer installed on your machine. After cloning this repository you can start the analyzing process by calling the _run_ task of the included _gradle_ build system:

```
git clone https://github.com/McPringle/friday.git
cd friday
./gradlew run
```

== Output

This program will analyze all Fridays between the year 1 and 3000. The output will show you the day of the month and the how often this day was a Friday. The output should look like this:

```
{1=5150, 2=5138, 3=5133, 4=5152, 5=5128, 6=5159, 7=5128, 8=5150, 9=5138, 10=5133, 11=5152, 12=5128, 13=5159, 14=5128, 15=5150, 16=5138, 17=5133, 18=5152, 19=5128, 20=5159, 21=5128, 22=5150, 23=5138, 24=5133, 25=5152, 26=5128, 27=5159, 28=5128, 29=4820, 30=4718, 31=2990}
```

If you want to analyze a different period of time, feel free to modify the source.

== Why

Just for fun! I read https://www.juengling-edv.de/freitag-der-dreizehnte/[this article] from one of my friends and decided to code a little program for absolutely no reason‚Ä¶ :-)
